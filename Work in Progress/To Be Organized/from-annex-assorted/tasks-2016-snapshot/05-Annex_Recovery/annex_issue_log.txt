Issue history:
Original annex started being unable to finish commit.
Second annex, I cloned and copied objects folder over.  Soon, same issue.
Third annex, cloned from elsewhere, use git annex get to get objects from
broken repo.  Same issue developed.
Fourth annex, cloned from elsewhere, was able to commit successfully
prior to adding objects from broken repo.
Some object in the broken repo seems to be causing this issue somehow.

Plan to resolve:
- copy all objects over again.  verify that issue immediately develops.
  
  I expect the issue will trigger when I add a set of objects with litelog.
  So I could narrow it either by narrowing the objects I add with litelog,
  or by narrowing the object I copy from the broken repo.

  I'll narrow the issue between the two, first.

annex: used to be annex.2, busted
annex.3: third repository, busted, holds objects
annex.4:
	1. cloned from delta
	2. added logs, no issue
  3. 10:24:24 EDT rsync --delete-during'd objects in from annex.3
  4. 10:25:10 EDT added small test file, sync'd with delta fine
  5. 2016-05-22 10:27:38
      I ran fetchall but ran by root by mistake.
      files were added with wrong permissions
      fixed permissions.  only two files were cpied, voicerecorder and muse.
      sync works fine.'
  6. ran fetchall (as root) again, got 4 sensorium files
  7. add and sync seems to work fine.
  So now this repository is functioning with additional objects copied into
  its annex folder.  It must have been something else which caused the issue
  on the other repo I initialized this way.
  8. I foolishly tried to git annex add the alphabetically first object from
  the annex/objects folder to get it annex's logs.  It failed when trying to
  _delete_ it to replace it with a link to itself, luckily it was not writable.

  I'll try using this repo - 2016-05-22 10:36:24 EDT

  I'll add the remotes one at a time and sync with them, adding litelog after
  each one.
  ISSUE: voice recorder files have not been removed from phone

  [ ] add remotes one at a time to annex.4
      for each remote, add from litelog before moving to next remote
  [x] nested repo is broken and wont' repair automatically; I have bnc now I can ask on chat
      it wouldn't repair because it wasn't unlocked
  [ ] get nested repo working fine.  this just means packing the objects
  [x] fix voice recorder files not having been moved from phone
      the list shown on the phone is cached.  the files have been moved.
