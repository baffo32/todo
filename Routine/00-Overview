  00-Overview
    This file, summarizes folder contents
  01-Tasks_Shielded_Space
    TODO list and goals descriptions while changing my life to live inside shielded enclosures

Subfolders:
  exercise
    scripts, logs and resources for doing scott sonnon's exercise programs
  meds
    scripts and logs for tracking my meds; includes a list of all meds
  routine
    scripts and logs for the routine system I was using prior to entering a shielded tent in 2018-03
  ttrack
    scripts and logs for tracking my progress and planning my time post-2018-03

    The ttrack script reports on how much time I spend pursuing different goals and activities,
    and recommends to me what to do next.

    It uses short uppercase 'GOAL CODES' to identify goals, to make it quick to type them on my phone.
    Descriptions of the goal codes are in the '## Goals' section of 01-Tasks_Shielded_Space .

    The following files control what it recommends to me:

    ttrack/goals_priorities.csv
      Target average hours-per-day for each goal/activity

    ttrack/routines.csv
      Target hours to wait between each routine
