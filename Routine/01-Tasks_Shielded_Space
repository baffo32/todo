	   take over a little
	-> there are a number of PI's that help TI's and do TSCM.
	   This guy was William J. Taylor. I downloaded the interview at www.mitchellefect.com/bill_taylor_interview.pdf linked from www.biggerthansnowden.com
- [X] mention concerns regarding recording_settings work
	-> SDRFF version field was not updated, appears is intended to provide
future compatibiliy.  perhaps should be used?
	-> actual device sample rate is not recorded
	-> software version is not recorded
	-> buffer overflow count not recorded
	-> field format is fixed which means adding new fields breaks compatibility
	-> consider: perhaps a string for commandline invocation, and fields that represent actual data and device state?
