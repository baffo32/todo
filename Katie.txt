Hi Katie,

I'm writing this while I remember.

You asked me to move my shielding tasks thing out of the projects folder.

I did that, but then I realized I ended up setting it up in the routines folder, when it's really more a tasks thing.

I wanted to clarify with you that organizing and categorizing is really hard for me at this time, I think partly because it's hard for me to remember things that are related
to the thing I'm thinking about and working with.

One of the things I'm really looking for here is help with regard to doing that.  How can we combine the systems together such that all the pieces are connected, but all the
uses are retained?

For example, you often propose a structure that involves planning for the next week and the next month.  I'm happy to try that out, but it hasn't worked for me in the past,
so I've instead been using systems that give me a way of picking something to try next in the moment (priority queues).  If we set up a new system, it would be great if it
could still include the uses of the old system (allow me to pick something to work on next, and handle commmonly not achieving my plans), and the content
of the old system could be migrated into it.  This migration is _really_ hard for me to do on my own, because concepts get so disconnected inside me.
