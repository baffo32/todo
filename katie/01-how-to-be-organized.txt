 Brainstorm ideas for how to be organized, consider
	- lots of todo items
	- karl can't remember what he cares about or plans
	- existing values and goals perhaps can be discerned from existing todo items
	- maybe need some things with deadlines?
	- karl can't do things realiably
	- maybe need concept of priorities?
	- simple?
	- too much stuff in this list?
	==> katie asks: what do you want to be trackable?
		- that's a good research question!
		- the GOAL is to move my life forward, or my goals forward
		- i can't spend all day checking things but it is gratifying and helps keep track of stuff
		- what is effective in making things happen?
	IDEAS:
		- checkboxes !
		- organizing assignments people when not working here
