(Notes for Katie: we want a way of dividing tasks among team members, 
a section for "things to bring up at team meeting," a way of tracking 
what has and hasn't been done. Including a done file or section so that 
activities can get moved and celebrated. Establish a system for reviewing 
and prioritizing activities, setting a weekly activity schedule, etc. have 
a regular check in for reviewing how the system is working and how to review 
it--a weekly activity that never leaves the list and would go on the calendar.
The first thing we add to the system: schedule regular integration of other 
things and regular system review.)
