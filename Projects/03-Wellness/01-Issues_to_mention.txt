	"I'm jerking away every 5-10 minutes if I try to take a nap during the day, even if I am incredibly tired.  I'd like to be able to nap during the day."
	04-12 past couple days I've woken up ~3 mam then tried to sleep after sunrise
	      today I even took a melatonin in the morning
	      when trying to leep during daytime now I am repeatedly jerked awake by
	      suddenly moving or intense anxiety
	      seems like some rhythm of mine is disconnected
- update vitamin D level; have moved into indoor tent and am vegan
	- perhaps update B12 too and any other vegan-related vitamins
- still recovering post-chemo, some low test counts after dr boubolis
	- [ ] bring boubolis test results; they're in my medical folder-file
