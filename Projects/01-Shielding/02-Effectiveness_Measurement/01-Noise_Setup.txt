I have a 12V unbranded "noise source" from ebay.
The RF output matches the adapters I have for the ham-it-up upconverter.

I'll need to power it, test it, and oscillate it.
- screwdriver & tools to rig wires
- controller to manage (arduino) (also order some more controllers, a couple good arduinos and a couple good rasperry pis)

I'll add these tools to what to do outside of the shelter, then work on the receiving end.
