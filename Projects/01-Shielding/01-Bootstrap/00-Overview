I've gotten a shielded enclosure strong enough to block cell signals.

The next steps for me are to move inside roughly permanently, and to measure its shielding effectiveness.

I'm organizing my goals and tasks in 01-00-Immediate_Tasks.
I'm using the system inside 01-01-Time_Tracking to manage how much time I am dedicating to different goals.
