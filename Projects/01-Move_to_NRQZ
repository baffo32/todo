- [X] Green Bank Observatory itself offers lodging for astronomers.  It's around $80/night.

- [X] I contact one provider of mobile satellite service.  They seemed unfamiliar with the NRQZ, but stated their device was a transmitter and hence would not be allowed in Green Bank.  Elsewhere it is stated that highly directional transmitters may be okay.

	NOTES
	Green bank lodging:
		Observatory itself
		Bear Creek Lodge: 4.77 mi
		Chestnut Ridge Country Inn: 5.6 mi
		Cass Inn: 5.1 mi
		Boyer Motel & Restaurant: 4.4 mi
	Restrictions are delimited at whole mile numbers up to 10,
	so the best place is the Observatory, and the second best
	is a tie between Bear Creek Lodge and Boyer Motel
	The Sugar Grove station has closed and does not appear the
	best choice here.
