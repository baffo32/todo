----
Techniques:
-> Mark on muse monitor when you have recognizeable experiences.
-> Journal your experiences when you can't do something.
  If you don't know where to journal, make a file called
  "hard_experiences_extended.txt" in either symptoms or freewrites.

-----
REWARDS, ONGOING GOALS, TASKS, SUBTASKS: THINGS YOU CAN DO
[ ] Fix life up
    [ ] Clean room
    [ ] Backup computer
    [ ] Do something to get $$, even if it's weird like trading prepaid cards.
    [ ] Exercise, even just a tiny bit, every day
    [ ] fix video logging not happening
    [ ] make QT logging app that stores as soon as recorded
        ^-- my logging apps are quitting without saving
            could alternatively write program to recover data, but not as valuable time investment
    [ ] Apply to VTC
    [ ] move all your git repositories into the annex repository
    [ ] debug and resolve internet connectivity and responsiveness issues
    [ ] Clean up this and related documents.  Consolidate all TODO lists and schedules.
    [ ] fix git annex situation.  this may eventually involve coding bugfixes.
    [ ] fix .viminfo error
    [ ] Close all browser tabs, turn them all into bookmarks
[ ] Shielded room etc
  [ ] Get a trailer.  This may be a better choice than a less mobile room, given desire to apply to college.
  [ ] Get a test result
      [ ] Compare some results by hand.  It's okay if it's hard.  Doing this will help you have a stronger idea of what's needed for the attenuation program too.
      [ ] Build a solid test box
      [ ] Staple to cardboard
      [ ] Make attenuation program work
          [ ] Try simple shifting to line times up as a next step
  [ ] Take notes on the EMC book
   Ideas:
      o Focus on the shielding chapter
      o If you don't understand something, leave a note, and keep going.
      o THEN you can fill in the gaps in what you don't understand.
[ ] Help mind feel more safe by understanding it.
    [ ] Do the eeglab tutorial or watch some videos to get yourself more working knowledge
    [ ] Check items in motivational feeling log TODO areas
[ ] Make a QT android app
[ ] Fun things that don't seem the most efficient choice
    [ ] Do some function analysis on your own.  Mix some waves, see how it goes.
        Leads to other projects like blood pulse video, low light video, could
        help with mind analysis, attenuation, and financial investment
[ ] Get more acreage under more of my control.
    [ ] Draft contract with regard to rights of use of land in trust
        - I think my dad sent me a copy of the trust doc.  I haven't run into it
          recently, it's likely in an e-mail or my unfiled papers.
        [ ] HARD: contact lawyer, ask for advice
    [ ] Find property with more acreage to propose to my mother to purchase.
[ ] Really hard things that need to be done
  [ ] Call John Branson.  Things to address:
    [ ] is he still my lawyer?
    [x] medical guardianship expired obviously
    [ ] advice rights of use of house in trust, legal backing?
    [ ] follow up system issues? e.g.*police putting me in hospital in mass
                                     *hospital keeping me longer than legal in
                                        portland
                  important to follow these things up to discourage them
                     happening to others (or me again)

----
TASK ARCHIVE.  DID I FINISH THESE?  WILL I RETURN TO THEM?
[ ] BYB circuitry troubleshooting until complete
    --> Although it would be useful to get this working, I have a Muse now
        and ordered an OpenBCI.  This is low priority, and should be stored
        somewhere or sold on e-bay.
[ ] Qora complete
    --> The state of Qora has changed since I wrote this.  They released what
        they had.  The next step for working with Qora is to ensure the
        repository is in a state such that new developers can easily come in
        and work on it (last I checked dependencies were missing).
[ ] Prep space and plans for building structure
    --> I'm not sure if royce st is okay with me building a shielded room
        inside the room they have for me.  I think I've addressed all their
        concerns, but I haven't gotten confirmation from Lana.  I also haven't
        cleaned my room spic-and-span so it looks super inspectable.
        [ ] Followup from Lana.  Check in with her again Monday Mar 28.
        [ ] Clean room with higher priority, see elsewhere




== Organization, Attempt #3? ==
Content:
- Goals guided by Values,Cares,Concerns,Needs,Desires
- Steps / Tasks to meet goals
- Item Attributes
    . e.g. a task class like HARD meaning I need to prioritize it highly and be gentle with myself doing it
- Associations (e.g. notes, planning)
    . Lengthy ones go in separate files associated with the task or goal
    . Small things get categorized individually (something I want to shove in my own face can go in a space dedicated to that)
- Dates, Times, Regularity
- Schedule techniques
===============================


===========================
== Scheduling Techniques ==
===========================
Focus Task For At Least A Day Technique:
			     Right now I'm trying bitcoins, physical security,
			     logistics, in a 3-day rotation (the first two
			     being important right now, the third necessary to
			     keep up on).  I think I'd have more fun with
			     longer than a day allocated to the first two.
			     Maybe the third belongs between them rather than
			     a separate day.  I first tried on a weekend.
		     These approaches are good for having fun.  Getting
		     medium-hard to easy things done, and boosting happiness.
		     There's another state I get into where I'm already happy
		     and hard things aren't hard!  I just do them!  A way to
		     move toward that state more?
Priority Queue Technique:
        Prioritized items move up in priority when they are not addressed.
        Items are prioritized by their "Need To Do".
        Need To Do presently is equal to Importance - Work Done + Oldness.
          Work Done will reset to zero for repetitive items; items describing activity for a day will have W:0 at the start of each day.
          Oldness will increase when an item is not addressed
          It is fine to update items by adjusting attributes that are not present -- decreasing importance when work is done, increasing importance as they get old.

		Once a week one of M 6p - 8:45p, T 11:45a - 2:30p, Th 2:45p - 5:30p
		Also available online.  Also an online computer security course.
	- Castleton college allows courses to be taken by non-matriculated students -- one could also apply
		Spring classes are Jan 11 - April 29 .
		I think non-matriculated registration is Nov 11 ish.  Application in my folder.
	- Joined 4 meetups, all seem stale
	- Rock climbing, hiking, yoga -- or do an activity of your own out of
	  home (foraging? climbing?)

===== Quadrant Todo List =====
==============================
Include everything I need to do.
Daily items go in Now.
Weekly items go in Later.
Archive items when they become automatic and are never forgotten.
Priority of categories/goals increases each time they are not addressed.
====================
== Now, Important ==
====================  DO ALL

0. ==>ACTUALLY REVIEW ATTITUDE TECHNIQUES<==  See if you can keep a helpful one in mind.
0. When your medium-term state changes, review all of your notes to yourself.

===> Scheduling thought: who wants to work for an hour when you could instead accomplish a goal?  easier to do tasks as goals, results, items

0. Today is Sunday Jan 3. 
1. [I:5, W:-0, O:2]. Work on this document for at least an hour
  [I:5, W:-0, O:1]. See if there is an item you need to add here.  Otherwise, add an item you want to do if room.  Preferably from elsewhere in this document.
  [I:5, W:-0, O:1]. Address a concept in the concepts document.
  [I:5, W:-1, O:1]. Set up repetition in your life, and be aware of the repetition, to practice repeatedly the different pieces of your life to perfection.
              Integrate this list with a schedule, such that I understand when to work on it and do scheduled items foremost.  Time when high priority
              items are scheduled will not be used for todo items.
              Review SCHEDULE at start of day.  Ensure, based on priority of scheduled items, that there is enough time to accomplish "Important, Now"
              tasks.
              Meds 3 times a day.  Smoothie in morning.  Shower, brush teeth morning.  Exercise.  brush teeth at night. 
              I:       5                    4          2(depending)             3     2(depending)             3 #2
              Shuffle items in schedule that don't have REQUIRED TIMES around.
              Shuffle what is in the schedule that doesn't have HIGH PRIORITY in with things I want to spend regular time on.
  [I:5, W:-1, O:2]. Trim down & organize whole document
  [I:3, W:-0, O:1]. Group out GOALS and TASK DETAILS
  [I:2, W:-0, O:1]. Work on TODO pile.
  [I:1, W:-0, O:1]. Add concepts, re: schedule usage -- tasks with deadlines, tasks with dates, tasks with a guessed amount of time needed to complete
  [I:3, W:-3, O:1]. Work on some kind of time management system, e.g. daily alarms (3 hours?), a priority queue
      this is both so you can practice your day like a fugue
      and so that you don't fall into hyperfocusing on things without considering if you're as effective as you can be
      Remember that you may need to be forced to change focus at some times.  Biggest problem here is motionlessness though.
      Because of concern of practicing things making things worse instead of better, came up with theory that intention of practice might be what
      triggers the getting-worse rather than improving.  Just in case, consider making a screensaver-like program, which checks if I've updated some
      goal-related canary and interrupts what I am doing to force me to do something that will help me be organized, successful, or whatever, like
      visiting this document.  (e.g. canary could be updating this document at least 1ce every 2 days)
  [I:1, W:-0, O:1]. Re-evaluate todo items in this doc.  unnecessary? duplicate? wrong category/priority?
2. [I:5, W:-0, O:2]. At least an hour addressing EVERYTHING needed to appear successful at my life
  [O:2]. exercise
  [*] shower & brush teeth in morning
  . make room look more tidy and professional (wash desk surface?)
  . review todo pile
  . shave if have worked on box for at least an hour
  [*] teeth in evening
  . community such as college that might surround me with intelligent working people and give me credibility with others in the future
3. [I:5, W:-0, O:2]. Work on box for at least an hour.  A few different influences, so don't obsess about it.  Just get it done whenever.
  <check!>[I:5, deadline:tonight]. Make box such that I can be inside it, and it has some degree of shielding effectiveness (cardboard, measure, enclosed)
4. [I:3, W:-0, O:3]. Spend at least an hour on things I was thinking I would finish before switching to this state of mind.
  [I:5, W:-0]. symptom log at least daily <==
  [I:4, W:-0]. fixing reboot situation with computer
      [I:5, W:-0] aufs
      [I:2, W:-0] encryption key
  [I:4, W:-0]. fixing ovh server
  [I:2, W:-0]. copying night and written notes down
  [I:1, W:-0]. one of my ongoing projects, perhaps the one I've felt most recently interested in, or the one that excites me the most if I can make sure I'm
                making forward progress and not restarting things repeatedly
6. [I:4, W:-1, O:3]. Pursue solutions for conflict between Castleton and Mooney.  Bus to wallingford possible after crew?  Rutland-area rideshare?  Any carpool in my classes or with similar schedules?
            Add to schedule, check @ SLR if anybody is going.  Check at new years event if anybody goes.  Add to schedule, will Dr. Mooney come to castleton on
            monday?  Add to schedule, which session of class shall I skip if needed on monday? (probably intro stats, is it morning or afternoon?)

6. If you've spent time on every item in this list, reward yourself.

=========================
== Now, Less Important ==
=========================  Move to Now, Important with highest priority
. Personal Logistics

. Non-crucial Daily Basics
	. Exercise
  . Organizational tasks
    . Update this list

. Learn to be and appear successful at normal life (goal: have complete personal freedom & never be hospitalized or harassed)
  . Spend time on a regular basis doing things that normal people spend time on
    which I do not (especially if they're things I want to have done).
    ("Allocate time to normal behavior" in hard tasks list)

    by piece.  If needed, recruit a friend to "nag" or remind me to do this.
  	. General cleaning reminder:  Often things can be thrown away because
	    they aren't needed.  But it makes me sad when I don't remember.  Leave

  . Clean all the data I have in my room (usb keys, paper)
  . Clean and organize my whole room

    and easily (get desktop working on computer, get XO charging with ease,
    zoneminder bugs I've bumped into ...)

======================

. Weekly
  . Call at least 2 people total on the telephone every week.
. Obligations

. Organization & Personal Logistics
  . Rediscover my bitbucket account and bring repos up to date
  . Take charge of life management (next step: ask insurance for report of what accidents they have on file and for an estimate of what my insurance would be)

    to nail down any funky behaviors I have (maybe this isn't what I meant?
    just copied 'Logging' from extensive task list)  just having data could help
    later if it can be made easy to correlate.


===========================
== Later, Less Important ==
=========================== Move to Now, Important with lower priority
. Learn to be and appear successful at normal life
  . Make sure you know how to write, for competitive work and education
  . Finish Ishmael.  Then start another book.
. Organization & Personal Logistics
  . Sell my extra CPU
  . Switch halloween off of aufs.  Dar namecoin backup is almost complete.
  . Ask dad to sign authorization for me to ride in other residents' vehicles.
  . Look for 'folding' functionality in vim so we can pop descriptions in and out of this list.
  . Keep track of bitcoin investments and fees and see how I am doing.  Make sure I'm not keeping all my money in one system.
  . Check up on namecoin limit purchase (1 mo? late November, Kraken -- btc-e has higher volume)
  . Check up on bitcoin market, buy or sell
    - this isn't working too well for me.  I think I'm presently unable to judge buy or sell decisions and don't seem to know how to read the data.
      I need to construct a system which can give me a set rule to follow or make the choice for me.  This can be a plan, a spreadshet, or a bot.
      Alternatively, I can try to find a state of mind where I'm better at making inferences from things I'm not very familiar with, and learning and
      inferring from a bunch of things which are new to me at once, and be sure to only make trading decisions in that state of mind.  I may not have
      described what is needed accurately here.  But when my judgements are rapidly changing and moving I am not helping myself financially.  I need
      to learn consistently.
  	- coincafe is too slow for jumping on a market change.  use a system
  	  that lets you preload dollars.
  . Figure out my relationship to internoc24, I must have an account, maybe even I have hosting still
  . Index and archive all the data on my computer or various places on the internet. (I think here I meant to find all this data, and organize it
  together.  Or I may have meant to transcribe and back everything up.  Perhaps review when conceptualizing well and decide what I feel I'd like to do.)

-- note insertion
Mooney says as going through old papers, I would encounter old writings that reminded me of when I used to think a different way.
I could find them distressing.  (Not the lists of grocery items).

Mooney was talking about sorting old data into "random" vs "important"
and I wanted to finish the thing which would involve describing to him the piece which was
relevant to being in a different state of mind where i cannot tell which is random and which is important

^-- this thing i just wrote fits in the "random" category and can be moved to a section totally filled with random stuff.  To deal with at a future time, on a regular basis, piece by piece.  If needed, recruit a friend to "nag" or remind me to do this. <-- This is NOW, LESS IMPORTANT

---

HARD TASKS (knock these out!):
=> Reminder: Christmas gifts were far harder than things I thought I might be "stopped" from doing (call lawyer, physical security (inc. box building), mind analysis)
             Understand that these are okay things to do.  Guess: If you should have concerns, they may be misplaced, and simply want to be addressed.
* Index and archive all old data I still have.
* Plan christmas gifts for Mom, Dad, Katrina, Tor at least
	- All ... I thought of calling other family members and checking in about their opinions
	- Mom ... maybe a knit/chrocheted item?
	- Dad ... I came up with the idea of a book related to photography
	- Katrina ...
		Well I think she majored in womens' studies and english and is now in public administration most recently (I think she even got a degree in it? but that's way too fast mom says maybe she's pursuing it)
		mom says she called Tor, talked only with Sophie and promised to visit her during Christmas.  planned vacation 23rd-29th. says communication with parents has appened. mom says there are a few places available to sleep in boston.
		katrina found new home for jake for a year or two now.  her roommate's two cats like her a lot.
	- Tor ...
		Well he has children.  And he used to like superman, may still.  He also has techy things, computers, but he's also kinda ludditey.  "Refuses to have anything to do with gifts".  Mom says kids are amazing, love absolutely everything, have no technology in their life, only wall rotary(?) phones! free thinkers, totally creatve, make up and pretend everything.  both read her detailed fantasy stories out of a blank book. mom says sherri loves plants, mentioned flowers. sherri is gluten free, lactose free, peanuts no good, bananas, anything made with grapes, may be vegetarian -- huge litany of hospitalizable allergies; mom has a list!
		mom says tor's house is very small, no furniture (wall to wall carpets?) planning holidays with sherri seemed to not go super well
	I'll check Tor and Katrina's facebooks maybe ? Or is it creepy?  Maybe it would make sense if I only gave them the kinds of things they would expect me to think of based on their interactions with me.
	I'm just exploring this I guess.
	Somebody gave me an arbitrary best-selling book.
	Ideas:
		- handmade gift (e.g. knitting) (I could make an iPad app maybe too)
		- making a frame up to look nice, maybe putting a personalized photo in it
		- maple syrup from the ranch!
* Call Mom
	ONCE A WEEK!
	-> check in
	-> home with more land
		-> says I can decide
		-> price range $160,000?
	-> medical guardianship?
		:: "nothing should interfere with my needs to control information about myself"
	-> flexible setup re: home (contract idea)
		would you be okay
		- if I did absolutely anything with the building
		- if I did absolutely anything with the land
		- if I had absolutely anybody living there (or asked people to leave)
		:: house is an investment, a nest egg; unusual things could lose $160,000 value.  this value should be something I can fall back on when 70.  But many changes could be improvements to the property value.  "I guess the only restriction I'd put on it if I were forced would be everything up to code or acceptable to the world at large (permits can be gotten for anything you can do)"  ask at town hall who to talk to about house improvements.  many ppl live totally off the grid (vt).  you have judgement now and can figure out who to allow to live in your space. (there are codes re: number of people, usually a lot, depending on place)
	-> help with rent?
		:: have to talk to bill, but perhaps parents would match my income to help me
:: "you are so brave going through that mouse adventure" maybe I should record phone calls, or think about this differently
* Call John Branson
	-> check in
	-> medical guardianship
	-> trust fund adjustments
	-> legal motion: MA hospital, ME hospital, ?
* Make at least 2 phone calls a week, one of them to Mom.
* Allocate time to normal behavior (shaving, paying bills, cleaning out mailbox, arranging hair)
OKAY I remembered what this is about.  This is for things that normal people
spend time doing that I am not spending time doing, especially things I want
to have done but have not dedicated time to.
Think about how things in your living experience might strike somebody else
(dense spiderweb in back of desk)
++ things to schedule:
++++ . anything important for maintaining my life that I am not otherwise
scheduling or spending time on
	that's what I have right now in my mind as the most similar to the
	original meaning of this item
	but while working on it I came up with other items I should also make
	sure I have time or intent allocated to if I would like
++++ . MERGING OLD TODO LISTS (and other old data or possessions)
		(this is in this normal behavior category because most people aren't scared of their old things and leave them hanging around untouched in fear of both forgetting or accessing them; they know what they're about, use them if they need them, throw them out if they don't, and store them somewhere appropriate, added Oct 27 2015 9:45 AM EST)

					^-- hygeine and appearance
					^-- financial stuff in a timely manner, but not having to be immediate
					^-- following up on phone calls / emails
					^-- tidiness, cleanliness, organizing
						- do you want to make your bed
						  daily?
						- your desk area is GROSS!
						  keep your area tidy with
						  reasonable priorities !!
					   - think about how things would
					     strike somebody else in your
					     living experience
					^-- LIFE PLANNING and PURSUING THAT PLAN
					 ^-- to generalize, having goals in
					 mind, and doing things to pursue them
					   ^-- Kelly says start off with the
					   goals, then once you've got those
					   worked out, migrate to a major life
					   plan
					^-- Deal with old stuff you've
					forgotten the purpose of. (usb keys,
					notes, possessions I might not use or
					even buy a new one of, things I don't
					want to remember or re-experience, ALL
					my things.  Deal with ALL my things,
					not just near or new ones.)

					^-- seasonal attire, and attire appropriate to time or place
					^-- social challenge: knock on door,
					"go dancing", do something out of the
					ordinary (go to a bar?) do an event
					with somebody else by inviting them to
					do it; visit somebody; find somebody
					not near you and initiate a
					conversation with them; say something
					embarrassing to somebody
					^-- Kelly reminds me that overwhelming
					things mean I will need to schedule
					self care as well
	- conflict discussion
		It's important to pay bills, wear warm clothes in winter, etc.
		Historically I've been resistant to "normal behavior", not
		seeing a reason for it or that it's a good idea, and not
		having been part of social groups engaging in it.
	
		I'm not sure if the intent of this todo item is to e.g. learn to
		dance, although it could be.

		I do believe the intent of this todo item was to cause myself
		to look nice.

		Also here is paying bills and cleaning out mailbox.  These are
		basic upkeep tasks.  They're kind of cultural, but I'm
		engaging in them.  I have paid my bills and cleaned out my
		mailbox.  But I think I may have been thinking of something
		general it's hard to come up with more examples of, or think
		what could be, right now. (Oct 26 4:30 pm)
* Organize papers & room. Consolidate information.
* Make sure some of my tasks involve other people in any way.  1 to connect 2 so social
  pressure keeps me on track.  It's even valuable just to interact with people
  regularly; they'll ask me what I'm up to occasionally, I'll bump into social
  interactions that assume I'm following my schedule.

. Sometimes I may be much slower than usual and may need a different schedule
to switch to make proper choices as to what to do next.  Or maybe I can sort
it out in the existing schedule by having priorities.  Or maybe it could be
helpful not to!  I didn't think I'd exercise this morning but ended up doing
it, and it did help me move on to working on my schedule. (Tue Oct 27 2015)

. I wrote this: Hard tasks may be hard because of hard aspects, such as
processing abstract thoughts without being able to logically represent them.
Practice hard _aspects_ without immediate goal -> hard task becomes easy!
Part of the idea is that when I need to accomplish a goal which requires a
very hard step, the step is like a blocking point, "I can't DO this", and if I
work on the blocking point with smaller goals (like small crunches) perhaps I
can get better at it and then ALL hard tasks blocked by it become easier.

	Would I like to stay up until 11?  I wake up before 7.  Maybe I'd
	rather start doing things before 7.  But it can be nice to work a big
	block.
	- I'd tried staying up late but I kind of got derailed from my schedule
	  by a computer issue I didn't workaround to stay on schedule.  I ended
	  up going to bed after 11 and never working on my todo list.  I still
	  woke up before 7, but it had only been one day.
	- (Tue Oct 27 2015) I'm seriously considering bumping my alarm up
	  earlier by at least half an hour to get more time for work.  I think
	  exercising a little prior to work helps me get on task.  But I feel
	  unsure about the opposite possibility of staying up later, so I'm
	  giving it at least another day to see how things go.  Will take
	  Valerian tonight, though.



Many tasks seem difficult for me to move forward on.  When the difficulty is
thinking, perhaps breaking into small pieces I can just do the piece for is
helpful.  How can I break hard tasks into small pieces?


==================================================================
I'll try to come up with an organization system for this document.
==================================================================
- A tree of TODO items.
	- Items near the root are GOALS THAT CAN BE WORKED TOWARDS to allocate time between.
	- Leaves are things that can be checked off.
- A tree or list of GUIDELINES, things that must always be done or always kept in mind.
- A regular schedule.  By week, for Rutland program.
- Dr. Mooney's Now/Later/Important/Less Important 4-quadrant todo list
- Dr. Mooney's "Spreadsheet" of item categorization.  Mark which categories in to right of item.  Some categories are Now, Later, Level of Importance 1-10 or 1-7
==================================================================
==less old discussion:==
A SCHEDULE of some sort is involved too.  Some things are not check-off-able items, but should be constantly worked on or done repeatedly (like brushing teeth to keep teeth clean), but I might miss them during my schedule.  I can add an item to schedule to check that I have done a certain list of items and complete them before I go to bed.
A tree of GOALS, DESIRES, CONCERNS might help on the side?  Because tasks can work towards multiple goals.
Some Guidelines are just to keep in mind when doing things.  Other ones involve scheduled tasks i need to keep up with.
Note that these intense setting things out is required because my brain isn't working properly.
Having my brain work properly so I don't need this all on paper is a GOAL THAT CAN BE WORKED TOWARDS.
==old discussion:==
Then I can go back to the organization system when updating or adding to it.
TASK GOALS and TODO right now seem like the same thing.  Earlier I thought
they were different and was moving TODO to TASK GOALS.
Perhaps the difference is that TASK GOALS has each root item "check-off-able".
TODO is currently a mish-mash of goals that can or can't be checked off.
====


- I added security rationalizations to AccessList.txt

GUIDELINES:
	These affect choices and design of tasks and must be checked against.
	GOALS OR VALUES IDENTIFIED:
	- Your Mind and All Its Parts Are Sacred To You
		- Don't harm it.  Don't let it be harmed.
		(spawns tasks)
	- Be Effective
		(pre-requisite for other goals)
		- Don't Lose Your Information Unless Your Memory Is Working Again
			- Copy everything down.  Back everything up.  Record what you
			  do.
			(spawns tasks)
	- Always Contribute To The Whole
		- whatever you do, do it in such a way that others can make use of it or
		  continue it.  this way your work contributes to things larger than yourself
		- don't disregard existing systems (national geographic, sierra club, wikileaks and other ting mentioned on facebook, EFF, ffchs, OTHER GROUPS) they could help or you could help
	

	GOALS OR VALUES UNIDENTIFIED:
	- Until You Can Remember All These Goals At Once, Organize Yourself on Reliable Storage
	- Build ongoing goals list and check against it to make sure it's being included.
	- Honor when you're excited about working on something on your list
	  that is different from your schedule.  You'll make more progress on
	  the whole list if you work on what you're excited about. (sometimes
	  you won't seem to be excited about anything, of course)
	- Complete tasks that feel emotionally impossible, like giving
	  christmas presents to family.
	- Copy anything you write down on paper into 'everything'
	- Check for cereal boxes every day
	- Exercise regularly (willpower crunches (I Think I've almost got this
	  down)) in morning: sweating in bed anyway
	- When having trouble, see if I can figure out a piece of the
	  experience that is what is actually really hard, so I can practice
	  it.  Perhaps then when having trouble with the task, if it does seem
	  totally impossible, I could spend the time practicing the part which
	  is hard (of course doing the task is great practice too).
	  	. processing abstract thoughts without being able to logically
		  represent them

GOALS IN NEED OF REFINING:
	- Something about nature or peace?  Living naturally? Activism?  Listening to the voices of others?
		- supporting the validity and possibility of natural ways (req peace?)
	- Something about security or safety or helping others?
		* A secure shared space addresses a variety of desires
	- Something about awareness of environment or tracking my own mind?
		- re: logging
	- "Protect from creepy abuse/control"
	// the other files in everything give hints as to where I was coming
	   from when I came up with some of these goal ideas

TASK GOALS: (things that can be checked off, TODO items)
	- Refine goals listed ABOVE in need of refining.  Nail down goals or
	  influences for goals that don't seem to have a point.  It's okay for
	  something to seem like a really good idea because I felt it was a
	  really good idea in the past -- more complex.
	  	- Steps: Just do it.  No overt subtasks yet.
	- Become As Capable As Anybody Else
		- Complete normal tasks that feel impossible.  Schedule normal
		  behavior so you fit into a culture.  Exercise.  Practice
		  social skills.  Tune your mind.
	- Have a tract of land I can do what I want with (I'm not sure what
	  for, but it's a fun idea, and I used to care about.  Perhaps I
	  should consider goals this may have been for.  It's still a good
	  thing to have.) (PRESERVATION OF WILDNESS is probably the kind of
	  thing this originally came from)
	  	- Move notes from conversation with mom here
	  	Notes:
	- Education to do things in modern ways so as to contribute to global
	  community.
		- Decide if I want to pursue formal college and what degree I
		  would pursue, where I would apply, how I could move forward
		  on Brown, if colleges that happen to be near where I'm
		  living are where I want to go.
			: If I had a college degree, I could get funding for research from bodies already giving it funding.  Of course, other behaviors can be funded by grants too.
			: Colleges usually require standardized testing scores that are recent
    - I've been moving a little towards pursuing formal education.  It could really help with the goal of surrounding me by things I need to be doing.
      Things I want to do: - Security - Engineering (Mostly electrical I think; EMI and signals) - Neuroscience/Medical Health - Resilient P2P Infrastructure
	- Acquire passport 
		* Print out application
		* Find photo
		* Reserve $140 for this
		* Find a place to submit the application
		- You have a birth certificate in the mail
		- submit application with birth certificate, license,
		  photocopy of both sides of license.  may also need social
		  security card.  ~$120?
		- Connect my other thoughts (p2p, anonymity, ionternational mc
		  group, PROBABLY OTHER THINGS) that sprung up from the travel
		  thought, to tease out new goals.
	  	Discussion:
			- I think I want to travel to conferences and
			  gatherings to contribute and join the global community
			  on topics I haven't found local community for
			- Part of Always Contribute to the Whole


	* Create a secure shared space (could delve into whys)
	* Logging of personal activities and experience
		Discussion:
			- Although this started as concern over security, this is now
			  relevent to help me gain consistency with the rest of the
			  world.  I experience things that don't match my perception
			  of the current state of things around me, due to memory
			  issues.  By recording what's going on I will be able to see
			  what I'm missing and try to sort out how I can address my
			  memory situation to maintain an accurate perception of my
			  immediate surroundings.
			  - "I thought I added these files to my usb key already.  I
			    was assuming they were there.  But they're not."
			  - "I thought I put that lamp on the floor.  But it's on the
			    nightstand."
			  - "Did somebody take my green computer?  Oh, hours later I
			    remember I put it in a milk crate where it's hard to see."


TODO:
*** This list is slowly moving to the task goals list.  I plan to make sure
I'm spending time-per-month or whatever on each goal or task goal.
- Buy a new USB key or sort out my USB key situation so I have a key I feel
  comfortable using for casual file transfer
* Passport
	* print out application
	* Find a photo
	- submit application with birth certificate, license, photocopy of both sides of license.  may also need social security card.  ~$120?
- christmastime
	* Come up with christmas presents to give people
	* Purchase and wrap the christmas presents
	- Mom, Dad, Katrina, Tor, Sophie, William, (Sherri?)
- Tune mind for behavior (willpower, schedule, hard tasks)
	* Note the content of the wednesday meditations to develop my own meditations.
	* Meditate regularly
	- Intent, Action, Will
	- Nonverbal awareness
	: note
		Something about meditation.  You got yourself out of bed (kind of, it ended up
		being 8:00 sharp) by jabbing yourself in your arm.  This demonstrates it being
		easier to jab yourself in the arm than to make yourself get out of bed
		directly.  If you have more skeletal muscle control than inner will control,
		perhaps part of this sensation of more skeletal muscle control has to do with
		a lot of natural input and awareness with regard to how your body is moving.
		Maybe you could feel like you had more inner will control if you had more
		natural awareness of the behavior of your inner will.  Even if you check in on
		it and find it flailing around uncontrollably, perhaps slowly working on
		having control can build your control up.  Maybe this is meditation.  Let's
		keep trying to meditate. (it's probably other things too).
	: psychological difficulties I've had
		- Suddenly becoming incredibly sleepy, associated with a task
		  or time
		- Forgetting suddenly, having unexpected behavior or feelings
		- Loss of willpower; getting worse and worse at doing things I
		  intend -- "laziness" worsening as I fight it (keep fighting it...!)
		- Difficulty generalizing, sorting, organizing
- Personal Land?
	* Call my mother and see what she thinks
	- Check in:
		- Contract would be accepted where I can do with property as I like?
		- Could we get a place with more land?
		- maybe also address what she thinks of medical guardianship
		  and of course social check in
	* Move forward on working with lawyer re: trust fund adjustments
	- Concerns with rowe ave:
		- small
		- father doesn't seem okay with some things.  Don't need to do
		  things, but need to have personal legal power. (fruit on roof)
	- ALTERNATIVE: question original goal.  Working with family
	  could work out (seems like a lot of work on their part though).
	  It's certainly BETTER THAN NOTHING so keep pursuing it.
- Papers and Notes
	* YOU CAN FORGET ANYTHING AT ANY MOMENT.  Please write things down.
	<check!> Separate mailbox categories out from pocket file.
	<check!> Organize paper categories between binders and pocket file
	* Look through the other todos copied below and consolidate them into this
	  todo.
		: note that this kind of thinking is often very hard for you
		: if you feel you can make some progress on this, you may want
		to DO A LITTLE RIGHT NOW! <-- the intensity of this caps
		expired.  next? (DOESN'T MEAN YOU CAN'T STILL DO IT)
	* clean up web browser tabs, organize into bookmarks, store in
	  everything
	* Add moloko below.
	- Add motd/issue files below.
	- Consolidate 'everything' notes (around what?)
		- Come up with ideas to consolidate them around
		* chronological summary
		* descriptions of beliefs and feelings I experience (or am experiencing now)
		* perceptions of indicators -- what makes things work, what makes things not work, how does this change
		* note that you get in a lot of different mind states where
		  this seems possible or not, and may have different results,
		  how to deal with?
* BASIC LIFE THINGS (EVERY DAY) and items for taking charge of life
	- anything my dad or others are doing for me or I have dropped
		- looking into auto insurance situation
			* Ask insurance for report of what accidents they have
			  on file and for an estimate of what my insurance would be
	- ask Dad for t-mobile bill or what the charges were for.  (although
	  remember he forwarded an account statement) (last checked this item Oct 24)
	  	* check when my dad sent the e-mail re: this to get good idea mail travel time
<check! but this feels different ...  hours might have been working better?
maybe try hours for a day or two again> How about this adjustment: rather than allocating hours, let's work on
  tasks, and leave smaller tasks to fill gaps in.  One task is sorting my
  mail.  See how today went.
* schedule organization for next day prior to bed.  Review next day.
- Infer intermediate + long term goals from todo items
	- set out goals and organize tasks to meet them.
- Small items to complete
	** Fill out internship application
	* Sync everything with two physical locations (usb key).  Then get in the habit of doing that regularly.
	* There's a partition on my usb key with electrical tape around it
	  that is not in the partition table.  Check out what it is.
- Practice figuring out life
	- other things to take charge of life
		-> if good idea, get record of police hospitalization in
		massachusetts, go to police of area I was handcuffed, get
		incident report -> also hospital intake
- Pierce's Store
	* Repair major bugs
	* Check in about job again
- Basic Logistics
	[...] Passport and Birth Certificate
		:ID for job, will be needed for internship
	* Organize a behavior schedule of my own (daily, weekly)
		* Keep working on this list at 9:00 daily
			- many of the 'hour a day' hopes and dreams are more
			  topical goals.  Sometimes an activity may meet
			  multiple goals.
			* Sort out the goals into categories and make sure I'm
			  making effective progress on all of them.  Line up
			  my schedule with what I find enjoyable & possible,
			  and the existing scheduled items I'm dealing with.
		* Allocate time to normal behavior and basic maintenance & logistics
			- things like cleaning out mailbox, paying bills, shaving, etc
		* Consolidate this section with the schedule I'm building above
		* Consolidate this section with the "hour a day" and "task
		  list" things mentioned elsewhere
		* come up with another behavior to be regular about, schedule it, add it here
		- 7 pm: Physical Security
		- 5 pm: Classwork
- Physical Security & Logging
	                 ^- AN HOUR A DAY TO LOGGING (need data to make analysis relevant to myself)
	* Work on this list for at least half an hour at 8 PM daily.
	* get some namecoin, it's a cheap way to seemingly permanently verify data
		- note that hashing things is a pretty common thing for distributed file stores
		- but still get some namecoin please
	- Added useful projects to physical.txt .  Maybe move everything
	  physical-security related to there.
	- Radio understanding
		* Write a script to log distant internet uptime
		* Compare script output to rtl log
	- Video security
		* Set up an XO with your existing external harddrive
			* Just do it
			[...] Get power adapter for XO
			* Set up XO anyway.  plug it in with floppy cord, install
			  zoneminder, connect external HD
		* Fix gstreamer situation on computer
		* Get a persistent server running in residence, both remotely
		  accessible and offering a local wifi network
		- Just do it with your laptop, when it happens to be available
		<check!> SET UP CAMERA SO IT SEES THINGS!
		- Get iOS program that can record sound and video at a moment's notice
		- Get Android program that can record sound and video at a moment's
		  notice
		- Set ZoneMinder up to run continuously
		: can I fix semi-busted laptop to use it?
	- Shelter
		^- AN HOUR A DAY TO SHELTER (do anything you can in your current situation, if you're not doing anything (or can't somehow), learn about it, or do experiments)
		* what can I do?
		- work on experimental setup.  make something reliable that
		  can measure some kind of attenuation.  Deal with noise floor
		  logged by rtl-sdr
		- work on usefulness of old data.  Import it all into one
		  system.  If you don't understand fourier in this context,
		  just copy the existing fourier code!
		  	- how can I learn about this kind of fourier? keep
			  going with linear algebra for one thing
			Things to do:
			- comment rtl-power to understand its processing steps
			- copy its code or write my own to perform these
			  processing steps and manage data (simple, not general)
			- combine data to extract local noise from useful
			  information
			  Approach 1: create separate local and distant plots
			  Approach 2: identify distant signals as frequency peaks, compare their magnitude <===
			:: A wide variety of resources for education are at http://gnuradio.org/redmine/projects/gnuradio/wiki/SuggestedReading
		- perform series of experiments to identify the usefulness
		  of a layer of aluminum foil, groundded aluminum foil, mylar,
		  paint mixed with ground metal, etc
	- Non-video logging
		- Sound, radio, can help me understand what's around me
		- These are all relevant to analysis as well as to security
- Information & Digital Security, & P2P Systems
	^- AN HOUR A DAY
	* Hey, I like this task.  Maybe I should do it for fun. 10/21 nighttime.
	- Set up SSH to use offline private keys.  Shouldn't need server modification at all.
	- Hey, you can make your versioned filesystem concept actually work by
	  making a merkle tree (if that's the right term) of the files and
	  adding the root hash to namecoin.  Perhaps git could be expanded to
	  do this.
	- Isn't it so useful to learn what a merkle tree is?  I should pursue
	  education here.
- Analytical Math
	^- AN HOUR A DAY TO EDUCATION RE: ANALYSIS ('education' of 'research & education')
	* I like this task too.  10/21 nighttime.
	* Read a chapter in a brain or math book I have.  Explore relevant concepts.
	* Understand what books I have, then add helpful books to previous item
	- Learn modern metaprogramming, make the basics of a CAS? (this is
	  preposterously big, something's wrong with thought processes here)
	  	^- AN HOUR A DAY TO PRE-ANALYSIS
	- Take classes / do research to learn about relevence of my analytical
	  processing ideas.  Synchronization/desynchronization?  OTHER DOMAINS
	  TOO.
	- Overlay functions in Matlab or C++.  Pull out waves, patterns,
	  images.
	  	^- AN HOUR A DAY TO ANALYSIS ('research' of 'research & education')
		: Note that I'm not educated enough to do these things the
		proper ways, so I might as well do them my own ways for now.
		- book scanning
		- beep detection
		- sound/radio

	- fix XO 1.5 display and keyboard (probably need to alcohol the innards)
	- fix NAT situation with new 4.1.12+ kernel: aufs works great but MASQUERADE is broken (probably can bisect to a stable release)
	- sync encsec with usb and net

	- fix your broken laptops (or get rid of them)
	- XO epiphany can't SSL handshake with gnuradio.org
	- another aufs bug; /var/db/pkg/sys-libs/glibc* won't rm -rf to install a new glibc (might be due to modification of overlay)


- COMBINE THESE WITH YOUR OTHER TODO LISTS.  Note any inner conflicts you have.
- Consolidate your notes.  Rewrite things in a more organized fashion.  Note
  your conflicts.
- If you have trouble with something, note it; note all your conflicts in the same place.  Go
  back to your trouble notes sometimes.


  ^--  won't noticing patterns in my trouble just cause me to have random trouble ????
    -> not if it's just my own old trouble
      maybe the patterns will stick aroudn to help me learn what not to do (or get over them, whichever is appropriate)
  -> or maybe, somehow, they will go away.  or at least noticing them will help me push straight into them and accomplish what I'm having trouble with

Here's a direct copy of the door todo list.  How do I make myself actually
consolidate these things?  I'm sure I can do it.
- Call parents re: [x]guardianship, <check!>transportation, rent

                            Beth: perhaps we'll match your income to double it, and that I should be in control of my information flow
			    [x]Christopher says that transportation will be sorted out

  get done.  Probably want to interact with others.  1 to connect 2 so social
  pressure keeps you on track
<check!>* Pay Verizon bill
- You still forget and unexpected behavior/feelings.  Work on this in any way
  so you can do consistent tasks.
