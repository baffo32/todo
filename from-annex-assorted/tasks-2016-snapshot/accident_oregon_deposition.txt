Deposition by phone Wednesday 9:30 PST, 12:30 EST
be by phone and available to talk, shouldn't take long

what to expect and how to conduct yourself
i will be on speakerphone in room
plaintiff attourney will ask me questions about me and the accident
court reporter will be recording

speak loudly enough that people can hear me
don't talk over anybody
wait for everybody to finish speaking before responding
if it's something i'm not sure about, ask for clarification before answering
only give FACTS you have first hand recollection of, it's fine to say I don't recall
don't include opinions or guesses

keep it short and sweet, no extra details needed
defendant has already admitted fault and accepted responsibility
lawyer not sure why they want to talk to me

i don't knowÂ anything about plaintiff, lawyer will handle that
if objection, just listen, then lawyer will tell me i can either answer it or not
my psychological history is privileged information and i am not obligated to testify with regard to that; lawyer will object to that
i have accepted responsibility anyway and personal issues are irrelevant
i can talk about what i said at the scene, but no need regarding conversations with health care provider

last talked with lawyer;
was 31 yrs of age, unemployed computer programmer
now 32, intern
we have pictures woman took, including one of me smiling
and one that could be a field sobriety test, but could have just been talking
pictures show damage to my automobile, including front left corner with duct
tape, and side door
does not include picture of front right where accident damage theoretically
would have occurred
lawyer says last we talked i said i only received some scratches from front right end
said october 15th 2014
with NEST northwest ecological survey team
heading from eugene to portland
perhaps exited I-5 to get gas or food, mrket st area where accident happened
near overpass
no tickets or citations
i was not injured
estimate less than 10 miles an hour
she said less than 5 miles amn hour
conversation at the scene, said to her i had some kind of psychological issue
affecting my driving

understand rear corner damage to her car is mostly from a prior accident
but don't say things that i learned only from lawyer, this is coonfidential
but i do not know what damage to her car is from my vehicle
and can say attorney showed me photos of my car and her car

may ask about other accidents
- cement to side door
- rocks driving on rough roads to undercarriage

- damage to driver side door?
- damage to front right?
- collision on highway, passing somebody turning to the left?
